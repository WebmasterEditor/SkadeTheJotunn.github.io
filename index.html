    <h2>About Norse Mythology</h2>
    <p>Norse Mythology is the ancient religion of the Vikings who came from the land of Scandinavia. Norse Mythology was originally the Norse's way of understanding the world around them, and slowly it evolved into tales of cunning and magic. Our greatest source for Norse Mythology are Snorri Sturlson's <em>The Eddas</em>. <br><br> Norse Mythology is used in many present day things. The days of the week deprive their names from Norse gods and goddesses and movies have been made using Norse Mythology, along with many books crafting NOrse Mythology into modern-day world.</p>
