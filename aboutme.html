   <p>I am a Norse Mythology fanatic! I hunt out as many books surrounding the topic as I can, plowing through them all. I originally found that I really enjoyed Greek Mythology, but after I started reading about the ancient religion of the Vikings, I wanted to know more. Many people know a lot about Greek Mythology, so I wanted to learn about something similar, but more obscure. </p>
